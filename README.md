2.  There are five projects which have been accomplished over here. They are as follows:

    a) Eliminate duplicates from the wikipedia edits dataset.(DuplicateDriver, DuplicateMapper, DuplicateReducer)
    
    b) Classify the changes whether they were added or deleted. (ChangesDriver, ChangesMapper, ChangesReducer)
    
    c) Count the changes made by registered and unregistered users over each of the criteria - Word Change, Line Change, Paragraph Change(ClassifyUserDriver, ClassifyUserMapper, ClassifyUserReducer, UserPartitioner)
    
    d) Identified top 10 users who edited maximun articles.(UserDriver, UserMapper, UserReducer)
    
    e) Identified top 10 maximum edited articles. (ArticlesDriver, ArticlesMapper, ArticlesReducer)
